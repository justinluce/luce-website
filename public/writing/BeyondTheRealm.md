# Beyond the Realm

Beyond the realm, it wakes
Between the rift, it waits
Wrath to be unleashed
To steal our God’s heartbeat

***

A fable from the void
A tiny pliant boy
Hopeful, brave, and strange
The eldest of its age

Though graceful as it grows
The whispers hiss from those
Sculpting for their needs
A sheep to fuel their creed

With passing years it changed
Repulsed by all their rage
Cautious, scared, and cold
Refused to fit their mold

In time, at last, it grew
Crowned king of all it knew
Doctrines fill its brain
Too much to be contained

It turned to its empire
And saw a rampant fire
Subjects dead and felled
Mankind entrapped in hell

Yet try and try it might
Its kind did naught but fight
Vengeful, crossed, and stressed
It joined their dark bloodlet

It fights throughout the land
Crushed heads and severed hands
Ev’ry war that ends
Two more spring up again

It blinks and cent’ries pass
It treads through fields of ash
Somber, worn, and drained
Succumbed to its own pain

To God it prays and pleads
To cleanse their bloody sea
Voice filled with despair
Echoes in the still air

A foolish, hollow prayer
To think a God would care
Renounced, lost, and vexed
It swore They would be next

***

Beyond the realm, it hates
Between the rift, it quakes
Flesh and bone, it grinds
To carve out what’s inside
